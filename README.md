# Session Capacity Monitor (Python)

## Overview
This project simulates real-world session capacity monitoring for infrastructure environments.

## Features
- Calculates session utilization percentage
- Compares against defined threshold
- Triggers alert when exceeded
- Generates CSV report
- Visualizes usage vs threshold using matplotlib

## Example Scenario
Max Capacity: 100  
Active Sessions: 92  
Usage: 92%  
Threshold: 85% → Alert Triggered  

## Why This Matters
Session overload can lead to:
- Performance degradation
- RDS instability
- License overutilization
- Unexpected downtime

This simulation demonstrates proactive monitoring logic.
